The Gravimetric Cognition Engine (v1.0 - Genesis)Wells is an experimental "Resonant N-Body Field Computer" that reimagines natural language processing by abandoning traditional neural network architectures in favor of fundamental physics simulation. Unlike Transformer models that rely on static matrix multiplication and massive pre-training, This operates as a dynamic, real-time vacuum where text is treated as physical matter.The Architecture: Physics Over WeightsAt its core, the Engine converts raw byte streams into 3D particles possessing Mass (semantic importance), Charge (structural syntax), and Frequency (spectral meaning). These particles are injected into a boundless void where they interact via a custom set of universal laws:Gravimetric Pull ($G$): Particles with high mass attract one another, creating dense clusters of related concepts.Electrostatic Repulsion ($K$): Charge creates structural bonds, maintaining the integrity of input sequences against entropy.Harmonic Resonance: Replacing the "Attention Mechanism," particles with similar frequencies exert a strong attractive force, allowing related concepts to group together regardless of spatial distance.Dynamic Learning & The Event Horizon features NO pre-training. Instead, it utilizes Hebbian Crystallization: when particles interact closely and resonate, they physically gain mass. This solidifies fleeting associations into heavy, permanent "gravitational wells" of memory.The system "speaks" through a Spectrometer Readout. A central Event Horizon at the core of the simulation monitors particle density. When enough mass of a specific frequency accumulates in the core, the engine emits a character—a quantum of meaning—before evaporating the particles back into the void. This is not a chatbot. It is a computational substrate where meaning is an emergent property of digital thermodynamics. It runs on PyTorch (compute only) and requires no datasets—only the laws of physics.
